<h1>DSAL Group A Practical NO.1</h1>

Consider telephone book database of N clients. Make use of a hash table implementation
to quickly look up clientâ€˜s telephone number. Make use of two collision handling
techniques and compare them using number of comparisons required to find a set of
telephone numbers

Use hash_table_template.cpp for working with int, long long, double data type using only one code (generic programming)
